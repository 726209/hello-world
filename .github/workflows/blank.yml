# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "main" branch
  push:
    branches: ['main']
  pull_request:
    branches: ['main']
  schedule:
    # - cron: "* * * * *"
    # - cron: '0 8 * * *' # 每天 08:00 UTC，即中国时间 16:00
    # - cron: '0 1 * * *' # 每天 09:00（中国时间）UTC+8 → 减去 8 小时
    - cron: '0 0 * * *' # 每天 08:00（中国时间）
